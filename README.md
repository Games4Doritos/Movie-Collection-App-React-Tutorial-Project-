# Movie-Collection-App-React-Tutorial-Project-
A react application that displays popular movies and allows you to favourite and search for numerous movies from The Movie Database (TMDB).  

To run the application:

1. Install node.js from https://nodejs.org/en
2. In a code editor or terminal, create a new folder of a relevant name and move to it in an open terminal
3. In the open terminal, enter 'npm create vite@latest'. It will tell you to enter a project name and package name. It will then say select a framework, select React and then select Javascript as the variant (up to your discretion).
4. Move to the directory of the package/project name and then enter 'npm install'
5. Replace the 'src' directory in the current directory with the src folder in main (the single parent folder in this repo)
6. In src/services/movieAPI.js, you must replace the <Your API key> string on the first line with your own API key from TMDB (make an account, go to settings/API and go through the process)
7. Enter 'npm run dev' and go to the where the application is localy hosted
